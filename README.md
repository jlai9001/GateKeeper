Gate Keeper - Home Automation

Website URL: https://gate-keeper-x14u.onrender.com/

This website is designed to showcase the design and implementation of 
an arduino-based home automation project that will fully automate the 
operation of our front gate. 

The gate will be activated using bluetooth beacons and processed through 
a programmible microcontroller alongside safety sensors. In addition, the 
gate will have a timer feature for user set schedules to have the gate stay
open. 

Finally, the gate will be fully adaptive to manual changes that are 
initiated by a human pressing on a remote. This is done by constantly 
monitoring the physical state of the game using limit switches.


This website is designed with the following technology:
  - Node.JS
  - EJS
  - Express

Automation Project:
  - C++
